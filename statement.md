Problem statement: 
This project focuses on designing and implementing a comprehensive collection of mathematical utility functions based on number theory, digit properties, prime analysis, modular arithmetic, and integer sequences. The objective is to write efficient, well-structured Python functions that evaluate various numeric properties, perform checks on special classes of numbers, generate mathematical sequences, and compute modular operations.
The assignment requires creating individual functions that solve specific problems such as computing factorial values, identifying palindromes, calculating digital roots, classifying numbers as abundant or deficient, generating prime-related sequences, performing divisor and factorization operations, and checking for special number categories like Harshad, Automorphic, Pronic, Mersenne, and Amicable numbers. Additional tasks include implementing algorithms for modular exponentiation, modular inverse, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, quadratic residue checks, Lucas and Fibonacci sequences, perfect power detection, and Collatz sequence generation.
Scope of the project:
The scope of this project encompasses the design and implementation of a comprehensive set of mathematical functions covering number theory, digit-based operations, divisor and factor calculations, prime-related algorithms, modular arithmetic, and classical integer sequences. Each function must be individually developed, tested, and documented to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and reusability.
